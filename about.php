                            I'm a recent graduate of OSU's Business school with a degree in Information Systems. My interests vary widely and are generally touched upon in this blog. In terms of sports I enjoy hiking,
                            biking, climbing and any other activity that gets me outside during the summer, and during the winter I try to ski as much as my schedule allows. I've been interested in all things
                            technology related from a young age and am actively working to improve my code skills. I have experience in C#, PHP, Java, Javascript, SQL, and relational databases, but am always working
                            to improve my skills. I also love hardware, maybe to much...
